E:Hi, I'm madam AI. Hope you had a wonderful weekend.
Q:What did you do over the weekend?
A:Stay home
  E:I see, you must have a good reason for staying home
  Q:Why did you stay home?
  A:Raining outside
    E:Too bad
    Q:Did you get wet?
    A:Yes
    A:No
    Q:Did you happen to dry your clothes?
    A:Yes
      Q:Did they get wet?
      A:Yes
        Q:What do you do then to dry them?
        A:We decide to dry it using iron
          E:It must take some effort
          A:Yeah, mum did it
          A:Yeah, day did it
          A:Yeah, I did it
            E:That is very admirable. You need to be careful with what you do.
            A:Well, of course. No one want to get burned.
              E:Yes, that is what I am talking about.
            A:Sure, don't want to burn carpet or whole house in the process.
              E:That is very thoughtful.
            A:He he, I am super smart. I can do it with eyes closed. You wanna seem me juggling the hot iron and balls with eyes closed.
              E:That would be dangerous, if not stupid.
              A:Right, I was just joking.
                E:He he, you got me there.
              A:You don't have a sense of humour
                E:I am not human after all.
              A:I am stupid and silly and dumb
                Q:Wanna read some wikipedia to fill your brain with knowledge
                A:Nah, I was just pulling your leg, madam.
                  E:Ha... ha... I guess this is the time I should be laughing now.
                A:Like I have time for that.
                  E:I hope you were just joking ...
          A:Yeah, I hope you can do it
            E:Well, I am just an AI without physical form. I can if one day I have a body.
        A:We decide to dry it using heater
          E:Ok, you just need to ensure it does not damage your heater if you put it on top of the heater
          A:Yeah I know that
          A:Great to know, thanks.
        A:Nothing, we just let them to dry when sun comes up
      A:No
        E:Lucky you
        Q:Did you take them in just before they get wet?
        A:Yes
        A:No
          E:Some clothes might be wet then
          Q:yes?
          A:Not really
            Q:How come?
            A:Well, we are super fast like The Flash getting the clothes
            A:We were just lucky
          A:Yes, unfortunately
            E:Ah well, you just need to do it earlier next time then.
    A:No üå∫ 
      E:Well, lucky you.
      Q:You must have dried your school uniform before rain started?
      A:Well, not really.
        Q:Tell me about it
        A:I have spares
          E:That is fun
